<h1><em><b> Analysis and Visualization on Haberman Data</b></h1></em>
<h3> The dataset is derived from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gilsousa/habermans-survival-data-set

<br><h5>Initially in the notebook, I have described about the dataset and its features and the purpose of the data.</h5>

<h3> The whole process is divided into 3 steps: </h4>
<h3><b>Step 1: Contains the initial exploration of the dataset</b></h3>
<h3><b>Step 2: Contains the plotting of various features in the dataset to analyze the important insights from the data</b></h3>
<h4> For visualization, I have used 6 types of plots:
<ul>
<li>Histogram</li>
<li>Pair Plot</li>
<li>Box Plot</li>
<li>CDF & PDF</li>
<li>Violin Plot</li>
<li>Count Plot</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Step 3: Contains the mathematical calculations on the dataset such as Mean, Median, Std-Dev </b></h3>
<h4> For Mathematical Calculation, I have used 5 parameters:
<ul>
<li>Mean</li>
<li>Median</li>
<li>Standard Deviation</li>
<li>Percentile-Quantiles</li>
<li>Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)</li></ul>

<h3><b> The last step contains the "Conclusion" which briefs about analysis on the visualization and calculations on the dataset. In this step, I gave all the insights on the data </b></h3>
